# NetworkApplicationAssignment
This repository is For my resume.
I wrote all code before 2021/09, but I need to show my skill of Network, so I upload these code files.

All of these code are mine.
You must not copy this code for your assignment.

  This code file is run to creat node for chat.
  
  When you open this program, you can set argv that setting portnumber and nickname.(In this case, We assume that run to same IP address. Real environment, we need to server node that let know where is other node IP address and Port number)
  
  And when you connected, you can chat to p2p case.
